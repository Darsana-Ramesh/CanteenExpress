## Project Summary

This project report outlines the complete life cycle of the **CanteenExpress** application — including its design, implementation, and performance evaluation. The system offers:

- A **user-facing interface** for browsing food menus and placing orders.
- An **admin dashboard** for managing food items, workers, and reviewing sales analytics.

The backend is supported by a well-structured **relational database schema**, leveraging normalization and optimized SQL queries to ensure efficiency, scalability, and integrity of operations.
